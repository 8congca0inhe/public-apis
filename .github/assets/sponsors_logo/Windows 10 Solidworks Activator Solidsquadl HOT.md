# How to Activate Solidworks on Windows 10 with Solidsquad Activator
 
Solidworks is a popular computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software that allows users to create, simulate, and analyze 3D models of various products and systems. However, Solidworks is not a free software and requires a valid license to run.

Some users may try to activate Solidworks on Windows 10 with Solidsquad Activator, a tool that claims to generate serial numbers and crack the software. However, this method may not work properly and may cause some issues. Here are some of the possible problems and solutions that users may encounter when using Solidsquad Activator:
 
- **Error 6: Access violation**. This error may occur when the activator tries to edit the Windows registry but fails due to insufficient permissions or antivirus interference. To fix this, users should run the activator as an administrator and disable any antivirus software temporarily. Users should also delete any existing Solidworks keys in the registry under HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software and HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software[^1^] [^2^].
- **Activator crashes or quits without confirmation**. This may happen when the activator is incompatible with the version of Solidworks or Windows 10. Users should make sure they have downloaded the correct activator for their Solidworks version and Windows 10 build. Users should also check if there are any updates available for their software or system[^1^].
- **Call home or legal risks**. Using Solidsquad Activator may expose users to potential security and legal risks. The activator may modify the hosts file or perform other sketchy actions to prevent Solidworks from contacting its servers and verifying the license. However, this may not be foolproof and may result in detection and deactivation of the software. Moreover, users may face lawsuits from Solidworks for violating their intellectual property rights and terms of service[^2^].

Therefore, users should be aware of the possible problems and risks of using Solidsquad Activator to activate Solidworks on Windows 10. Users should also consider purchasing a legitimate license from Solidworks or using alternative free or open-source CAD/CAE software.
  
If users are looking for free or open-source CAD/CAE software alternatives to Solidworks, they have several options to choose from. Depending on their needs and preferences, they can find software that offers different features and capabilities, such as parametric modeling, 3D creation, animation, rendering, video editing, game creation, solid modeling, and Boolean operations. They can also find software that works on different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and UNIX-like.
